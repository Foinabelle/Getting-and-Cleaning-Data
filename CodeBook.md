Codebook for data "tidydata.txt"

The data has 81 variables - 79 of these realate to measures taken via a Samsung Galaxy Smartphone while subjects undertake acitivities.  The other 2 variables are the subject identifier and the Activity.
Each data point is a mean value for the subject on each measure whilst doing one of the activities.  There are therefore, 6 measures for each of the 30 subjects giving a total of 180 rows.

Activity is labelled as follows:

WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, LAYING, SITTING, STANDING

Subjects have a number ID between 1-30

Measurements:

1. Measures are taken from either the Time or Frequency domains
2. Triaxial (X,Y,Z) data was taken using the internal gyroscope and the accelorator.  The accelorator measures acceloration while the gyroscope measures velocity.
3. The acceloration is divided into measures from the body and measures from gravity.
